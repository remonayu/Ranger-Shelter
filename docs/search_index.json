Just as the internet revolutionized communication as we know it today, professionals on the subject expect the Metaverse to do the same. Future MBAn students are more than likely to experience the evolution of this concept and even start utilizing it in their classrooms and workplaces. We envision that our project is going to be a handout on how Metaverse is going to impact each area of our day-to-day lives, especially the transformation from 2D interaction (Zoom/FaceTime) to 3D interaction (metaverse). We are going to start with the principles that lead to more efficient teamwork in 2D, followed by the technological innovation that Metaverse could bring to it, such as tracking eye contact, body language, facial micro-expression, and the elimination of physical distance in 2D interaction. This would result in a more natural and psychologically safe environment than common video call platforms, leading to a more efficient communication and teamwork experience. Under those innovation points, we would include detailed discussions about teamwork in different aspects of our lives where interaction happens, such as Work, Study, Business, Medicine, Social Media, and Traveling. At the moment, we expect the following to be some of the topics we will include in our handbook: How work will look like in the Metaverse How will the Metaverse create a better work-life balance How will the Metaverse create a more psychologically safe environment How simulations in the Metaverse can affect team decision-making, education, and an alternative form of communication through simulations The future These, however, are subject to change as our research dives more deeply into the topic. Other than the positive changes that Metaverse will bring to our workspace, we are also expecting to see revolutionary transformation in other relevant areas. For example, we envision that Metaverse will create a new economic environment, with countless business opportunities. With the adoption of Metaverse, we expect to see an upgrade in our current technological devices and software. Everything that we now do online — gaming, social media, entertainment, shopping, will all be altered in order to fit in the Metaverse. Despite the amazing changes that Metaverse promises, constant exposure to it may also bring potential downsides —- addiction, privacy issues, losing touch with the real world and people, discontinuation of cultures and traditions, etc. In our handbook, we will instruct the future students of MBAn on how to approach Metaverse in moderation.

I grow up from Suzhou China, a place known with a lot of rivers and bridges. I came to the United States 5 years ago, and went to high school and undergraduate at upstate NY. I always wanted to explore new places in the United States, not just for travel but actually stay there and experience everything there, because I stayed in NY for so long. I am super happy about the opportunity to study at University of Michigan, a completely different place than NY, which is kind of a dream come true opportunity hahaha, and I love here a lot so far. My goal for this year is to finish the program successfully and take the most from the program, have fun and make lots of friends! 5.2 Remona Yu Hello, My name is Liyang Yu (Remona).

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
