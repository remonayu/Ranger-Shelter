Especifically, this manual will include general information about the Metaverse, its benefits, and how to use it to its potential in various different settings. "],["proposal.html", "2 Proposal", " 2 Proposal NEED TO UPDATE We see the Metaverse as an inevitable technological revolution in the future. Just as the internet revolutionized communication as we know it today, professionals on the subject expect the Metaverse to do the same. Future MBAn students are more than likely to experience the evolution of this concept and even start utilizing it in their classrooms and workplaces. We envision that our project is going to be a handout on how Metaverse is going to impact each area of our day-to-day lives, especially the transformation from 2D interaction (Zoom/FaceTime) to 3D interaction (metaverse). We are going to start with the principles that lead to more efficient teamwork in 2D, followed by the technological innovation that Metaverse could bring to it, such as tracking eye contact, body language, facial micro-expression, and the elimination of physical distance in 2D interaction. This would result in a more natural and psychologically safe environment than common video call platforms, leading to a more efficient communication and teamwork experience. Under those innovation points, we would include detailed discussions about teamwork in different aspects of our lives where interaction happens, such as Work, Study, Business, Medicine, Social Media, and Traveling. At the moment, we expect the following to be some of the topics we will include in our handbook: How work will look like in the Metaverse How will the Metaverse create a better work-life balance How will the Metaverse create a more psychologically safe environment How simulations in the Metaverse can affect team decision-making, education, and an alternative form of communication through simulations The future These, however, are subject to change as our research dives more deeply into the topic. Other than the positive changes that Metaverse will bring to our workspace, we are also expecting to see revolutionary transformation in other relevant areas. For example, we envision that Metaverse will create a new economic environment, with countless business opportunities. With the adoption of Metaverse, we expect to see an upgrade in our current technological devices and software. Everything that we now do online — gaming, social media, entertainment, shopping, will all be altered in order to fit in the Metaverse. Despite the amazing changes that Metaverse promises, constant exposure to it may also bring potential downsides —- addiction, privacy issues, losing touch with the real world and people, discontinuation of cultures and traditions, etc. In our handbook, we will instruct the future students of MBAn on how to approach Metaverse in moderation.

Users need to start up the application on a PC or console before starting a VR simulation. Then, the user can put the headset on and adjust it to fit. Users will also hold the controllers and start to control the experience on screen through their body move and the controllers. Once everything is ready, the user will be immersed in the scene, which will move and interact as if they were in real action. There are a few steps to set up a VR space before starting to use it: Step 1 - Make Sure to Have Plenty of Space It is better to have more space for VR setup, at least 6.5 x 5 feet is recommended. Chairs, tables, and anything you can bump into while using VR should be kept away from the VR space to avoid tripping hazards. You should also consider having enough airspace, for example low ceilings, or dangling ceiling lights that you can easily touch on are not recommended. Finally, try to avoid reflective surfaces and windows while using VR because they might cause tracking issues of the headset and controller and make your view spin out of control. Step 2 - Setup the Base Station VR headsets and controllers rely on base stations for tracking their exact locations in order to create the illusion of room-scale immersion in virtual reality. It usually comes with two base stations to help the VR work. To set up Base stations, it needs to be diagonally mounted across from each other and above the head, solidly to avoid wobble. There are few ways to mount the base station. You can choose to mount it into the wall which is the most ideal way to save spaces and usually it’s more stable. You can also mount it on camera tripod stands, which you can easily move around, but it will take up floor space and maybe it will get in your way when you use it. 3.2 WiFi and Troubleshooting Help One recurring problem in today’s world is issues with your wireless connection. Like in other consoles and devices, a virtual reality headset will still work without internet connectivity, however, any application that requires wifi will not load properly. If you are inside an app that is dependent on wifi connection, then usually a pop-up appears inside the VR headset screen, and it also usually allows users to try to reconnect/fix the problem without taking the headset off. Nonetheless, the application usually freezes until the problem is solved or the application is closed. The following are a couple of links created by developers from some of the most popular VR brands that can help if you are having issues with your internet connection or you need troubleshooting assistance in general: https://store.facebook.com/help/quest/articles/fix-a-problem/troubleshoot-headsets-and-accessories/trouble-connecting-to-wifi-quest-2-or-quest/ https://www.vive.com/us/support/vive/category_howto/troubleshooting-headset-display.html https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/playstation-vr-troubleshooting/ "],["burnout-and-health-effects.html", "4 Burnout and Health Effects 4.1 Avoiding Burnout 4.2 Dealing with Health Side Effects", " 4 Burnout and Health Effects 4.1 Avoiding Burnout Create a dedicated workspace in the Metaverse In order to set boundaries between work and daily life, people should only put on the working headsets and accessories in a dedicated area of the room. By doing so, people would need to go to the workroom and start working. If the working headsets are put in the relaxing area of the room, people may casually start working, and it will be very hard to set boundaries. If you don’t have clear boundaries, your entire house will end up becoming a workspace, even after hours. Set Working hours and strictly follow the schedule In remote work space, it is very easy for people to lose track of time, and the condition may be worse in the Metaverse. In a highly realistic Metaverse workspace, people may not notice at the end of a work day, and continue to work after hours unintentionally. Therefore, it is crucial to have strict work hours, and be intentional about it. Although people tend to focus a lot on all their work, people need to keep track of time to avoid burnout. 4.2 Dealing with Health Side Effects Similar to gaming and social media, using VR too much will likely lead to behavioral addiction. The user or their family/friends would notice that the user’s quality of life is now suffering because of them being involved in VR. The addiction problem may take the form of ignoring everyday tasks, not wanting to engage with family/friends in real life, and getting frustrated when the user doesn’t get to use VR. Behavioral addiction can then lead to more mental health issues like mood disorder, stress, depression, and physical health issues like nausea, dizziness, disorientation, motion sickness. In order to step out of the negative loop, we suggest that users set a time limit to VR usage everyday. We suggest that the user’s friend or family member should take away the hardware when the time limit is up, so that the user will not be tempted to continue using it. We recommend that the user incorporate time for exercises or other activities that do not involve sitting down staring at the screen. Taking a walk outside, going to the gym, or simply hanging out with friends outside will be immensely beneficial to the user’s mental health. If the user’s addiction problem becomes increasingly out of control, we recommend the user get professional therapy. If you are currently suffering from any sort of behavioral addiction, please refer to these websites for professional guidance: SAMHSA "],["potential-in-different-professions.html", "5 Potential in Different Professions", " 5 Potential in Different Professions The highly interactive feature of VR brings opportunity for precise scenario imitation, which works best with professions that require high interaction and multiple scenario practices. Following such principle, we collected the data of current VR imitation for students in three study fields. Criminal Justice With the purpose to bring more training experience for criminal justice students to form a clear decision in various cases, VR training software offers a big screen, sound immersion, and scenario setting to help students engage in case practice. Through this training scenario, students are required to define the mission objective, then apply language intervention/external intervention to solve the case. Five major scenario settings have been included: de-escalation, use of force, mental illness, skill drills, and low light. All the scenario settings are created based on case reports that appear in the United States in the past 5 years, to form the most realistic scenario for testing. Medical Training The VR system shapes the practice environment by simulating the real cause of the patient’s illness. During the surgery, software displays instructions for the trainer and provides credit/feedback after the training has been completed. Meanwhile, dual/multi-perspective are supported, to increase proficiency and cooperation for the surgery team in reality. The learning mode also allows a better understanding of the position and structure of human organs, by allowing multiple perspective interactions between trainer and 3D patient model. For example, the spine model can be removed from the patient’s back for a better observation. Repetitive practice and real time recording are also outstanding points of VR training model, providing big help with retrospect problems. Business Team Cooperation Based on the curriculum of business studies, students have a high frequency to work as a team. To improve the efficiency of team cooperation, VR could build an environment that allows higher interaction and better demonstration of thoughts. VR scenarios could build multiple rooms/environments/space for various purposes: meeting room, classroom, style or capacity is fully manageable. During the meeting, students could present files more conveniently to others, bring files in PDFs, image, video, or even 3D models to present. Meanwhile, they can use any space as a canvas, to present drawings, paintings, writing, all these forms for notes record or idea demonstration. Besides those, more body interaction could be supported in the VR meetings than in typical voice/video calls. Hand shakes, hugs, bows, are possible to form a higher psychological safety between team members. carlo #new chapter qwejfnoq;wef "],["cross.html", "6 About Us 6.1 Mengna Wang 6.2 Remona Yu 6.3 Runze Huang 6.4 Jennifer Feng 6.5 Carlo De los Santos", " 6 About Us 6.1 Mengna Wang Hi, this is Mengna Wang.
