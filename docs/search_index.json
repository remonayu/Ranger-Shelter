Users need to start up the application on a PC or console before starting a VR simulation. Then, the user can put the headset on and adjust it to fit. Users will also hold the controllers and start to control the experience on screen through their body move and the controllers. Once everything is ready, the user will be immersed in the scene, which will move and interact as if they were in real action. There are a few steps to set up a VR space before starting to use it: Step 1 - Make Sure to Have Plenty of Space It is better to have more space for VR setup, at least 6.5 x 5 feet is recommended. Chairs, tables, and anything you can bump into while using VR should be kept away from the VR space to avoid tripping hazards. You should also consider having enough airspace, for example low ceilings, or dangling ceiling lights that you can easily touch on are not recommended. Finally, try to avoid reflective surfaces and windows while using VR because they might cause tracking issues of the headset and controller and make your view spin out of control. Step 2 - Setup the Base Station VR headsets and controllers rely on base stations for tracking their exact locations in order to create the illusion of room-scale immersion in virtual reality. It usually comes with two base stations to help the VR work. To set up Base stations, it needs to be diagonally mounted across from each other and above the head, solidly to avoid wobble. There are few ways to mount the base station. You can choose to mount it into the wall which is the most ideal way to save spaces and usually it’s more stable. You can also mount it on camera tripod stands, which you can easily move around, but it will take up floor space and maybe it will get in your way when you use it. Different types of VR devices * Standalone devices such as Oculus that do not need to connect to the computer, but can download content directly from the internet to make it work * Another types such as HP headsets needs to connect to the computer to create virtual reality environment However, VR headsets are not necessary, any laptop or smartphone can help people easily enter the metaverse through different platforms. 3.2 Classroom &amp; Business Integration How do schools integrate the Metaverse experience in classes? Like we mentioned above, the Metaverse provides an interoperable experience that combines the digital world with the physical world. More and more industries started to explore the Metaverse as one of their resources; schools are beginning to use it as their teaching tools to provide a better learning experience for students through immersive experiences. Schools mainly get access to the Metaverse through different platforms and resources such as ISTE from the company Roblox, STEMuli metaverse, Labster (a virtual labs and science simulations platform), ENGAGE and Mozilla Hubs (VR platforms that provide a simulated environment for virtual collaboration). For example, the first school which uses a Metaverse platform in class is called Dallas Hybrid Prep. The school is cooperating with STEMuli Metaverse and allows students to join the class and complete assignments from home through their laptops or tablets. “Our fifth-grade students join with their teachers while learning from home to collaborate and complete gaming-style assignments, using avatars and earning online currency for completing the assigned tasks.” - Olga Romero, founding principal at Dallas Hybrid Prep. Besides, with the VR headsets and controllers will make the experience more immersively in class, which also allows students to interact with each other even if they are thousands of miles apart. With the technology of VR, students can do things such as virtual field trips, explore the human body, as well as a tool for art and creativity. Nowadays, two major players Meta and Roblox are investing heavily to expand the Metaverse in education. Meta is investing $150 million in Mera Immersive Learning, while Roblox is investing millions of dollars to help different educational organizations create virtual learning experiences. How do businesses integrate the Metaverse experience in the workplace? In the business world, similar to the school settings, companies usually create online in-office experiences through Metaverse, employees can move and interact with each other with an avatar in the virtual office place by using VR headsets. For example, With NextMeet’s immersive platform, employee digital avatars can pop in and out of virtual offices and meeting rooms in real-time, walk up to a virtual help desk, give a live presentation from the dais, relax with colleagues in a networking lounge, or roam a conference center or exhibition using a customizable avatar. Participants access the virtual environment via their desktop computer or mobile device, pick or design their avatar, and then use keyboard buttons to navigate the space: arrow keys to move around, double click to sit on a chair, and so forth. [3] It shows that the immersive working experience is more productive than the traditional way. Accenture has announced to onboard 150,000 new hires who will use VR headsets to work from the Metaverse on their first day. The company’s virtual campus on the Metaverse is called the Nth floor, and people will meet, collaborate and learn there. The immersive experience is said to be 30-40% more productive than traditional ways of learning. [4] 3.3 WiFi and Troubleshooting Help One recurring problem in today’s world is issues with your wireless connection. Like in other consoles and devices, a virtual reality headset will still work without internet connectivity, however, any application that requires wifi will not load properly. If you are inside an app that is dependent on WiFi connection, then usually a pop-up appears inside the VR headset screen, and it also usually allows users to try to reconnect/fix the problem without taking the headset off. Nonetheless, the application usually freezes until the problem is solved or the application is closed. The following are a couple of links created by developers from some of the most popular VR brands that can help if you are having issues with your internet connection or you need troubleshooting assistance in general: https://store.facebook.com/help/quest/articles/fix-a-problem/troubleshoot-headsets-and-accessories/trouble-connecting-to-wifi-quest-2-or-quest/ https://www.vive.com/us/support/vive/category_howto/troubleshooting-headset-display.html https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/playstation-vr-troubleshooting/ "],["educational-use.html", "4 Educational Use 4.1 General Classrom Use 4.2 Immersive experience for classroom 4.3 Examples in Different Professions 4.4 Potential for the Future", " 4 Educational Use 4.1 General Classrom Use Students VR is going to give teachers and students what previously have been unavailable. Teachers could use VR for simulations, giving the students an almost realistic setting. For example, over the past week, the students of OYM participated in a business simulation called BizCafe, where students managed a new coffee shop. Though the website made this simulation extremely detailed, it didn’t feel real. However, if we were to use VR for this simulation, we could have really immersed ourselves in a “real” coffee shop, and “seen” its daily operations. As shop owners, we could’ve “talked” to the npc’s like employees and customers. VR would’ve added a “realistic” touch to the online simulation. In general, students are more attracted to less conventional teaching methods. Aside from using VR in simulations, teachers should incorporate VR in regular, everyday classroom, where they “transport” students into the subject they are studying. Students will be able to literally “touch”, “see”, and “interact” with the things they are studying. For example, medical students can use VR to operate on bodies; engineering students can use VR to build models; computer science majors can use VR to “move” codes around, and see the “inner mechanism” of softwares, etc. VR gives teachers the possibility to create a truly immersive and interactive studying environment, and the actual content should depend on the subject. By doing so, students will definitely become more attentive in the classroom. As you can imagine, a virtual class environment will include more distractions than a conventional classroom. In order to only impose positive changes to the classroom, the teachers need to make sure of the following: Before the classes start, the teachers should set rules for classroom etiquette. The rule should include things like no smartphone usage or limited activities that are unrelated to the class material. The teacher should set clear expectations for the students, and openly communicate with them. Be explicit about when the students should be participating, versus when they are free to explore on their own. It is ok for students to socialize during class, but only during the time frames set by the teachers. Limit class time to keep students engaged with the right amount of energy. This can also avoid the possibility of burnout or other negative health implications from using VR headsets for an extended period of time. The professor should only use softwares that aligns with the educational goals, have been widely adopted, and backed up with extensive technical support. Make sure that the class material’s learning curve is not too steep for the students’ level. Always prioritize the students’ safety and security. Using VR in the classrooms will revolutionize the education industry. Students will be able to get hands-on experience in the classroom, improving the lesson’s effectiveness and students’ productivity. However, the teachers need to make sure that VR does not sidetrack their students’ academic progress. Professors In this section, we explore the instruction from professor’s perspective. Based on under story we have created from professor interview, the concern of “increase student’s productivity in class” will be addressed. To design the instruction of a productive metaverse classroom, it is important to understand the motivation factor behind productivity. The article, improving educaiton productivity from Herbert J. Walberg, examines the factor that influence productivity by meta-analysis and control group research. The following table summrized nine factors on educational productivity, followed by propotional learning effect as decimal number list on the right. 4.2 Immersive experience for classroom Factor effect productivity In this section, we explore the instruction from professor’s perspective. Based on under story we have created from professor interview, the concern of “increase student’s productivity in class” will be addressed. To design the instruction of a productive metaverse classroom, it is important to understand the motivation factor behind productivity. The article, improving educaiton productivity from Herbert J. Walberg, examines the factor that influence productivity by meta-analysis and control group research. The following table summrized nine factors on educational productivity, followed by propotional learning effect as decimal number list on the right. Based on table 1, we can confirm that a student’s knowledge of a particular field is heavily dependent on his or her own judgment of achievement/ability. If a student has achieved good grades in finance in the past, he/she will be more motivated to learn finance in the future because of the default “I am capable/gifted in finance”. Based on this factor, we can infer that when a professor helps students to reshape their perceptions of a field from “knowledge is difficult and I don’t want to learn it” to “knowledge is not difficult and I can understand it”, it has a significant effect on students’ motivation to learn This will have a significant effect on students’ motivation. The implementation of this approach requires not only efficient teaching methods but also positive psychological cues for students. To ensure the long-term motivation and productivity of students. The article also assesses the impact of delivery methods by measuring the effectiveness of students’ understanding of new knowledge. table 2 shows the impact of the nine most common delivery methods used across the United States. Re-deisgn the class structure based on educational factor on productivity With the proportional learning influence on educational productivity, we generated seven principles to form a productive classroom. Followed by the degree ranking of influence factors on education. Those include: Provide diagnostic test/background survey to measure student’s skill and capability for class content. Modifying the class structure and content according to the student’s background to provide suitable content for gaining higher knowledge. Range class on grade/credit. Provide different amounts of homework and completion time based on range. For student to better understand the class concept in line with their self learning ability. Provide hour estimation for concept undertstadning, assignment, and group project. To help student better understand time and effort expect from the class Increase morale/perception of class to ensure a better learning environment. Action could include increase class interaction/group discussion/group work Offer well-designed homework to collaborate with class lecture, to help student better understand class concept/knowledge Prohibit possible distraction to classroom, especially electronic devices Constantly review the quality of instructional experience. Review should be based on class feedback and overall performance of students. (quality of instructional experience should include psychological metod &amp; curricular aspects) Metaverse Classroom principle We provide a draft on metaversmic classroom principles based on the Zoom Teaching Code published in 2021 from the University of North Carolina. The following principle was created based on the scenario of a complete metacosmic classroom (). (*Teachers need to adjust the following rules based on how dependent the classroom is on the metaverse and how long vr devices are used:) 4.3 Examples in Different Professions Virtual reality in education is especially useful for learning visual and tactile subjects, rather than conceptual and abstract ones. VR excels at creating simulations that leave a long-lasting impression on the student. People are more likely to remember experiences rather than lectures from a teacher. The following are examples of possible uses in different subjects. Criminal Justice &amp; Business Cases With the purpose to bring more training experience for criminal justice students to form a clear decision in various cases, VR training software offers a big screen, sound immersion, and scenario setting to help students engage in case practice. Through this training scenario, students could be required to define the mission objective, then apply language intervention/external intervention to solve the case. Currently, company X has developed a similar product which includes five major scenario settings: de-escalation, use of force, mental illness, skill drills, and low light. All the scenario settings are created based on case reports that appear in the United States in the past 5 years, to form the most realistic scenario for testing. Similarly, business students can be put into the actual cases that they are assigned to read. They can explore a company themselves, look at the operations taking place, be in a presentation when the case exhibits are being presented to the company, and much more. There could even be interactivity between the user and an NPC, or an non-player character. Imagine being placed into a company operating during the Great Recession. The business student will probably understand a crisis, high-stakes environment and the actions to take much better after this experience. Finally, if technological advancements allow, the student can give their optimal solution to the case and see the effects of their solution on the business going forward. This gives the student the ability reflect and understand what went right and/or wrong in their decision-making Medical Training A VR system application can be used to imitate the practice environment of a surgeon by simulating the real cause of the patient’s illness. Another company, Y, that is developing an application for surgery simulation has included a software display with instructions for the trainer and provides credit/feedback after the training has been completed. Meanwhile, dual/multi-perspective are supported, to increase proficiency and cooperation for the surgery team in reality. Their learning mode also allows for a better understanding of the position and structure of human organs, by allowing multiple perspective interactions between trainer and 3D patient model. For example, the spine model can be removed from the patient’s back for a better observation. Repetitive practice and real time recording are also outstanding points of VR training model, providing big help with retrospect problems. Scientific Concepts Most students love whenever it is experiment day in their physics, chemistry, or biology class; and experiments are still incorporated into classes because there are benefits to doing hands-on activities. In-class experiments can help students retain information more clearly and understand more fundamentally the concepts being taught. Experiments, however, are limited by the availability of physical resources and time teachers and professors have to set up. Using Virtual Reality to conduct experiments in the classroom allows students to have pseudo-hands-on experiences and the set up for a VR scenario can be done much more quickly and efficiently than in person. For example, the Doppler effect explains why Formula 1 cars’ sound goes from high to low as they pass through you. This is the sound of a Formula 1 car passing by someone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HgTpWgw6q8 As an object emitting waves, or sound waves in this example, moves relatively closer to you, the waves clump up, getting to you with more frequency. As the object passes by you and moves relatively away from you, the waves reach you with less frequency. And this video explains the Doppler effect more clearly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4OnBYrbCjY Imagine if instead of watching this explanatory video, a student could put on a Virtual Reality headset and be placed on the front row of a Formula 1 event. A car approaches you from one side, emitting sound waves of the screeching, squealing and scraping of the car. As it passes by you, you hear the pitch of the sound go down. The sound waves reach you less frequently, thus lowering the pitch. This would probably be a much more memorable experience 5 years from now, than the example video provided above. History Courses Finally, Virtual Reality could make the lecture and reading based history class one of the most fun courses for students by, similar to the business case applicability, fully immersing students into events of the past. Going to class, putting on a headset, and in the blink of an eye suddenly appearing moments before Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address would be nothing short of immersive and memorable. One thing history class can teach is the facts, but one it can not truly convey to students are the feelings felt throughout some historical events. Virtually being in the middle of the crowd during the ‘I have a Dream Speech’ would probably make any student understand the sheer magnitude of importance and emotions experienced at the moment. 4.4 Potential for the Future "],["company-use.html", "5 Company Use 5.1 Commerce 5.2 Entertainment", " 5 Company Use 5.1 Commerce With the rise of digital commerce, the Metaverse will unlock new opportunities for buyers and sellers to connect in a new way. You could imagine your shop on Instagram becoming more immersive, with the option to buy physical or digital products as we saw in Jackie Aina’s space during Connect. NFT One of the most popular commerce products in metaverse is NFT, which stands for Non-fungible token. “Non-fungible” means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. For example,A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you’d have something completely different. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you’d have something completely different. NFTs can really be anything digital (such as drawings, music, your brain downloaded and turned into an AI), but a lot of the current excitement is around using the tech to sell digital art.NFTs are designed to give you something that can’t be copied: ownership of the work (though the artist can still retain the copyright and reproduction rights, just like with physical artwork). To put it in terms of physical art collecting: anyone can buy a Monet print. But only one person can own the original. 5.2 Entertainment Today you can host a paid online event on Facebook, but imagine if you could make this a mixed-reality experience where people could join in person or buy a ticket for the virtual experience. We saw this during Connect when two friends were able to enjoy the same concert, one in person and the other joining in the metaverse. The Metaverse Application in Aespa The Aespa girl group debuted in 2020 and made the first move into the meta-universe market for the k-pop market. Aespa is the group formed by 8 people, but technically only 4 real humans, and the other 4 is their avatar.The company created an origin story for the group, setting a special identity for each of them.They were born to fight a group called the Black Mamba, which threatens the connection between girls and their avatars. This concept of combining teams and The Metaverse has been strongly welcomed by Generation Z. Each Music video is interspersed with a large amount of the Metaverse concepts, visual sound effects, and avatars performance. And this concept is also widely used in their CD products, by scanning the QR code on the CD, fans can view the videos and voices recorded by Aespa members through the mobile phone app, or interact with their avatars.The Metaverse market concept has brought extremely popularity to Aespa, and also made K-POP realize the power of the Metaverse concept. Perhaps in the future, we will see more K-pop idol groups using the concept of Metaverse. "],["sociocultural-implications.html", "6 Sociocultural Implications", " 6 Sociocultural Implications Metaverse will bring along as much change as the internet has done for human society years ago. It will create a bond between people from all over the world, but it will also pull people apart. When people interact in the Metaverse, they bring their own values and culture into the mix. If people are allowed to design an outfit for themselves in the Metaverse, some people may be inclined to wear something that they would normally be too embarrassed to wear. They might go for traditional outfits, or flashy ones that are very expressive of the individual’s personality. In a way, Metaverse, like the internet, allows people to be different, and embrace the difference. Metaverse will eventually form sub-cultures of its own, like the internet did over the years. It will be “used as a route to access a community, to influence their experiences and it can also be a means of social communion, just like the TV and radio before it.” Countless new ideas and values will merge and form a cultural norm strictly in the context of the Metaverse. The Metaverse will break down the geographical barriers in the real world, and create a universe without boundaries for people from different backgrounds. It brings about the interaction and overlay between the real and the digital. Like how the internet broke down barriers many years ago, the Metaverse is only going to magnify this effect. With VR technology, it will make sharing much easier and realistic. Right now we can only share pictures and videos. but with the help of VR headsets, other people can experience your content in 3D view. This will almost be like a more accessible and affordable traveling method. As a result, people can get to experience different countries, languages, cultures, and traditions without even stepping foot out of their house. Some experts think that the Metaverse will cause devastating effects on the global cultural environment. The Western values and norms are dominating the international community. The ideas are exported to the other continents and countries through social media, the entertainment industry, etc. The Metaverse, created by Meta and supported by mostly western companies, will be constructed with Western values and norms as its foundation. If we use Metaverse on a global scale, everyone will be immersed in the same digital cultural environment, which will “hasten the decline of political and cultural diversity”. Only a handful of superpower countries have more leverage in shaping the world’s shared culture. These cultural exchanges are unidirectional. In airports, you can only see ads from companies that are from politically and economically advantaged countries. The weaker countries only get to adopt the habits, traditions and even languages from the more powerful countries. And you may ask, how do some countries still have their unique traditions? In Spain, people are still maintaining their very different daily schedule. “One of the most powerful forces persevering distinct cultures and communities is their unique physical surroundings.” The unique physical surroundings give people the right place to practice their unique ways. Then culture is further strengthened through human interaction in the physical communities of those countries. From human interaction, we get the culturally-specific elements like food, fashion, entertainment, architecture, arts and literature, etc. The digital medium of interaction is impersonal. Right now the majority of us still prefer meeting face to face rather than phone calls and Facetime. If the Metaverse is widely adopted, it will reshape the cultural norms of many countries other than the US and Europe, from which the metaverse’s own norm is constructed. We are already seeing examples of this phenomenon, from the usage of English across all international businesses, to the social media platforms like Instagram, facebook, twitter, TikTok, where the community guidelines are built based on the western norms, and all the users must adhere to them, no matter where they are from. It is hard to say whether the political / ideological conflicts or differences between countries would cause individuals, communities, or companies to be banned from the Metaverse. For now we see posts being taken down on social media, but how will that materialize in the Metaverse. Will the individuals in question be banned from existing in the Metaverse, almost like that one episode of Black mirror? What will the cancel culture look like in the Metaverse? What does blocking someone look like? The lack of variation and competition will eventually dim down the creativity and diversity of our global community. If someone is dissatisfied with their country’s values, they can leave for another one which they think is better. But what if the Metaverse leads to the unification of values in the world, people will lose the ability to pick and choose. Ultimately, the Metaverse will potentially introduce the unification of values, norms, cultures, “exacerbating the existence of universal groupthink and cultural homogeneity” "],["burnout-and-health-effects.html", "7 Burnout and Health Effects 7.1 Avoiding Burnout 7.2 Dealing with Health Side Effects", " 7 Burnout and Health Effects 7.1 Avoiding Burnout Create a dedicated work space in the Metaverse In order to set boundaries between work and daily life, people should only put on the working headsets and accessories in a dedicated area of the room. By doing so, people would need to go to the workroom and start working. If the working headsets are put in the relaxing area of the room, people may casually start working, and it will be very hard to set boundaries. If you don’t have clear boundaries, your entire house will end up becoming a work space, even after hours. Set Working hours and strictly follow the schedule In remote work space, it is very easy for people to lose track of time, and the condition may be worse in the Metaverse. In a highly realistic Metaverse work space, people may not notice at the end of a work day, and continue to work after hours unintentionally. Therefore, it is crucial to have strict work hours, and be intentional about it. Although people tend to focus a lot on all their work, people need to keep track of time to avoid burnout. 7.2 Dealing with Health Side Effects Similar to gaming and social media, using VR too much will likely lead to behavioral addiction. The user or their family/friends would notice that the user’s quality of life is now suffering because of them being involved in VR. The addiction problem may take the form of ignoring everyday tasks, not wanting to engage with family/friends in real life, and getting frustrated when the user doesn’t get to use VR. Behavioral addiction can then lead to more mental health issues like mood disorder, stress, depression, and physical health issues like nausea, dizziness, disorientation, motion sickness. In order to step out of the negative loop, we suggest that users set a time limit to VR usage everyday. We suggest that the user’s friend or family member should take away the hardware when the time limit is up, so that the user will not be tempted to continue using it. We recommend that the user incorporate time for exercises or other activities that do not involve sitting down staring at the screen. Taking a walk outside, going to the gym, or simply hanging out with friends outside will be immensely beneficial to the user’s mental health. If the user’s addiction problem becomes increasingly out of control, we recommend the user get professional therapy. If you are currently suffering from any sort of behavioral addiction, please refer to these websites for professional guidance: SAMHSA "],["team-process.html", "8 Team Process", " 8 Team Process "],["about-us.html", "9 About Us 9.1 Mengna Wang 9.2 Remona Yu 9.3 Runze Huang 9.4 Jennifer Feng 9.5 Carlo De los Santos", " 9 About Us 9.1 Mengna Wang Hi, this is Mengna Wang.

This guide will answer this question and more. We want to help our audience understand what is the Metaverse and other related terms, ideas on how to use it properly, and what is its potential to transform our lives in an education and business context. "],["background-information.html", "2 Background Information", " 2 Background Information What is VR VR, Virtual Reality, is a technology that simulates the real world in a virtual environment, and there are four important features that define this technology. Multi-Sensory: When people use current technology such as phones, computers, and television, the media generally stimulates them from the visual sensory, because most media is still two dimensional. Although movies now support three, or even four dimensional format, the lack of immersion stagnates the growth of these technologies. In virtual reality, people need to put on headsets and grab controllers to experience the simulated world, which leads to experience in multi-sensory. Other than visual sensory, people would experience auditory sensory, movement sensory, touching sensory, and even tasting sensory. In an ideal virtual reality, people should be able to experience most of the sensory they can experience in the real world Immersion: With the Multi-Sensory feature, people should be able to feel like they are in the real world. Therefore, a sensory experience is evaluated by the level of immersion that the system brings to users. A good virtual reality should give the users a hard time distinguishing the real world from the virtual world. Interactivity: Interactivity determines if Users are able to interact with objects in virtual reality. For instance, if users want to grab an object in virtual reality, the user needs to feel the momentum of grabbing and feel the weight of the object too. Imagination: Other than creating a world that highly simulates reality, Virtual Reality gives users the opportunity to create inventions and new ideas that are beyond reality. The ability to create things or life that are not in reality will unleash people’s imagination. What is the Metaverse? VR is the technology that allows people to enter a virtual environment, and Metaverse is a new social institution that allows people to meet and interact in virtual reality. This new platform allows people to break boundaries and connect with people from around the world. In this manual, you will learn potential ways to utilize the Metaverse as people from different professions. How to get access to Metaverse With the VR technology, VR headset and controllers are essential tools to maximize the experience on Metaverse. In fact in 2020, Meta released its own VR headsets, Meta Quest 2, retailed at $399. Comparable products in the market Other than the Meta Quest 2, there are a few similar product offerings in the market. This section will list the product, the purchase link and price Meta Quest Features: 6DoF, LCD display, 3D positional audio, 1832 x 1920 Resolution Per Eye Price: $399 Pico Neo 2 Features: 6DoF, 4K display, 101° field of view (FOV), built-in spacial stereo speakers Price: $699 Pico Neo 2 Eye Features: Every Neo 2 features plus an eye-tracking technology Price: $899 HTC Vive Features: Single front-facing camera, adjustable velcro straps, uses an HDMI to connect to your machine, 2160 x 1200 resolution Price: $899 Valve Index Key Features: 130° FOV, 6DoF, externalized audio, 2880 x 1660 resolution, canted lens design Price: $999 "],["set-up-guide.html", "3 Set Up Guide 3.1 Virtual Reality 3.2 Classroom &amp; Business Integration 3.3 WiFi and Troubleshooting Help", " 3 Set Up Guide 3.1 Virtual Reality When VR space is set up, there are three peripherals needed to immerse into virtual reality: Headset provides the VR visual, controllers provide the physical control in VR world, and headphones to give the audio experience.

Teachers could use VR for simulations, giving the students an almost realistic setting. For example, over the past week, the students of OYM participated in a business simulation called BizCafe, where students managed a new coffee shop. Though the website made this simulation extremely detailed, it didn’t feel real. However, if we were to use VR for this simulation, we could have really immersed ourselves in a “real” coffee shop, and “seen” its daily operations. As shop owners, we could’ve “talked” to the npc’s like employees and customers. VR would’ve added a “realistic” touch to the online simulation. In general, students are more attracted to less conventional teaching methods. Aside from using VR in simulations, teachers should incorporate VR in regular, everyday classroom, where they “transport” students into the subject they are studying. Students will be able to literally “touch”, “see”, and “interact” with the things they are studying. For example, medical students can use VR to operate on bodies; engineering students can use VR to build models; computer science majors can use VR to “move” codes around, and see the “inner mechanism” of softwares, etc. VR gives teachers the possibility to create a truly immersive and interactive studying environment, and the actual content should depend on the subject. By doing so, students will definitely become more attentive in the classroom. As you can imagine, a virtual class environment will include more distractions than a conventional classroom. In order to only impose positive changes to the classroom, the teachers need to make sure of the following: Before the classes start, the teachers should set rules for classroom etiquette. The rule should include things like no smartphone usage or limited activities that are unrelated to the class material. The teacher should set clear expectations for the students, and openly communicate with them. Be explicit about when the students should be participating, versus when they are free to explore on their own. It is ok for students to socialize during class, but only during the time frames set by the teachers. Limit class time to keep students engaged with the right amount of energy. This can also avoid the possibility of burnout or other negative health implications from using VR headsets for an extended period of time. The professor should only use softwares that aligns with the educational goals, have been widely adopted, and backed up with extensive technical support. Make sure that the class material’s learning curve is not too steep for the students’ level. Always prioritize the students’ safety and security. Using VR in the classrooms will revolutionize the education industry. Students will be able to get hands-on experience in the classroom, improving the lesson’s effectiveness and students’ productivity. However, the teachers need to make sure that VR does not sidetrack their students’ academic progress. Professors In this section, we explore the instruction from professor’s perspective. Based on under story we have created from professor interview, the concern of “increase student’s productivity in class” will be addressed. To design the instruction of a productive metaverse classroom, it is important to understand the motivation factor behind productivity. The article, improving educaiton productivity from Herbert J. Walberg, examines the factor that influence productivity by meta-analysis and control group research. The following table summrized nine factors on educational productivity, followed by propotional learning effect as decimal number list on the right. 4.2 Immersive experience for classroom Factor effect productivity In this section, we explore the instruction from professor’s perspective. Based on under story we have created from professor interview, the concern of “increase student’s productivity in class” will be addressed. To design the instruction of a productive metaverse classroom, it is important to understand the motivation factor behind productivity. The article, improving educaiton productivity from Herbert J. Walberg, examines the factor that influence productivity by meta-analysis and control group research. The following table summrized nine factors on educational productivity, followed by propotional learning effect as decimal number list on the right. Factor Proportional Learning Influence A. Student Aptitude Ability or preferable prior achievement as measured by the standardized tests 0.92 Development as indexed by chronological age or stage of maturation 0.51 Motivation or self-concept as indicated by personality tests or the student’s willingness to persevere intensively on learning tasks 0.18 B. instruction Amount of time students engage in learning 0.47 Quality of the instructional experience, including method (psychological) and curricular (content) aspects 0.18 C.Psychological Environments Morale or student perception of classroom social group 0.47 Home environment or “curriculum of the home” 0.36 Peer group outside school 0.20 Minimal leisure-time mass media exposure, particularly television 0.20 (Table 1) Based on table 1, we can confirm that a student’s knowledge of a particular field is heavily dependent on his or her own judgment of achievement/ability. If a student has achieved good grades in finance in the past, he/she will be more motivated to learn finance in the future because of the default “I am capable/gifted in finance”. Based on this factor, we can infer that when a professor helps students to reshape their perceptions of a field from “knowledge is difficult and I don’t want to learn it” to “knowledge is not difficult and I can understand it”, it has a significant effect on students’ motivation to learn This will have a significant effect on students’ motivation. The implementation of this approach requires not only efficient teaching methods but also positive psychological cues for students. To ensure the long-term motivation and productivity of students. Category Average Effect Identifying similarities and differences 1.61 Summarizing and note taking 1.00 Reinforcing effort and providing recognition 0.80 Homework and practice 0.77 Nonlinguistic representations (e.g., maps and other graphics) 0.75 Cooperative learning 0.73 Setting goals and providing feedback 0.61 Generating and testing hypotheses 0.61 Activating prior knowledge 0.59 (Table 2) The article also assesses the impact of delivery methods by measuring the effectiveness of students’ understanding of new knowledge. table 1 shows the impact of the nine most common delivery methods used across the United States. Re-deisgn the class structure based on educational factor on productivity With the proportional learning influence on educational productivity, we generated seven principles to form a productive classroom. Followed by the degree ranking of influence factors on education. Those include: Provide diagnostic test/background survey to measure student’s skill and capability for class content. Modifying the class structure and content according to the student’s background to provide suitable content for gaining higher knowledge. Range class on grade/credit. Provide different amounts of homework and completion time based on range. For student to better understand the class concept in line with their self learning ability. Provide hour estimation for concept undertstadning, assignment, and group project. To help student better understand time and effort expect from the class Increase morale/perception of class to ensure a better learning environment. Action could include increase class interaction/group discussion/group work Offer well-designed homework to collaborate with class lecture, to help student better understand class concept/knowledge Prohibit possible distraction to classroom, especially electronic devices Constantly review the quality of instructional experience. Review should be based on class feedback and overall performance of students. (quality of instructional experience should include psychological metod &amp; curricular aspects) Metaverse Classroom principle We provide a draft on metaversmic classroom principles based on the Zoom Teaching Code published in 2021 from the University of North Carolina. The following principle was created based on the scenario of a complete metacosmic classroom (). (*Teachers need to adjust the following rules based on how dependent the classroom is on the metaverse and how long vr devices are used:) 4.3 Examples in Different Professions Virtual reality in education is especially useful for learning visual and tactile subjects, rather than conceptual and abstract ones. VR excels at creating simulations that leave a long-lasting impression on the student. People are more likely to remember experiences rather than lectures from a teacher. The following are examples of possible uses in different subjects. Criminal Justice &amp; Business Cases With the purpose to bring more training experience for criminal justice students to form a clear decision in various cases, VR training software offers a big screen, sound immersion, and scenario setting to help students engage in case practice. Through this training scenario, students could be required to define the mission objective, then apply language intervention/external intervention to solve the case. Currently, company X has developed a similar product which includes five major scenario settings: de-escalation, use of force, mental illness, skill drills, and low light. All the scenario settings are created based on case reports that appear in the United States in the past 5 years, to form the most realistic scenario for testing. Similarly, business students can be put into the actual cases that they are assigned to read. They can explore a company themselves, look at the operations taking place, be in a presentation when the case exhibits are being presented to the company, and much more. There could even be interactivity between the user and an NPC, or an non-player character. Imagine being placed into a company operating during the Great Recession. The business student will probably understand a crisis, high-stakes environment and the actions to take much better after this experience. Finally, if technological advancements allow, the student can give their optimal solution to the case and see the effects of their solution on the business going forward. This gives the student the ability reflect and understand what went right and/or wrong in their decision-making Medical Training A VR system application can be used to imitate the practice environment of a surgeon by simulating the real cause of the patient’s illness. Another company, Y, that is developing an application for surgery simulation has included a software display with instructions for the trainer and provides credit/feedback after the training has been completed. Meanwhile, dual/multi-perspective are supported, to increase proficiency and cooperation for the surgery team in reality. Their learning mode also allows for a better understanding of the position and structure of human organs, by allowing multiple perspective interactions between trainer and 3D patient model. For example, the spine model can be removed from the patient’s back for a better observation. Repetitive practice and real time recording are also outstanding points of VR training model, providing big help with retrospect problems. Scientific Concepts Most students love whenever it is experiment day in their physics, chemistry, or biology class; and experiments are still incorporated into classes because there are benefits to doing hands-on activities. In-class experiments can help students retain information more clearly and understand more fundamentally the concepts being taught. Experiments, however, are limited by the availability of physical resources and time teachers and professors have to set up. Using Virtual Reality to conduct experiments in the classroom allows students to have pseudo-hands-on experiences and the set up for a VR scenario can be done much more quickly and efficiently than in person. For example, the Doppler effect explains why Formula 1 cars’ sound goes from high to low as they pass through you. This is the sound of a Formula 1 car passing by someone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HgTpWgw6q8 As an object emitting waves, or sound waves in this example, moves relatively closer to you, the waves clump up, getting to you with more frequency. As the object passes by you and moves relatively away from you, the waves reach you with less frequency. And this video explains the Doppler effect more clearly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4OnBYrbCjY Imagine if instead of watching this explanatory video, a student could put on a Virtual Reality headset and be placed on the front row of a Formula 1 event. A car approaches you from one side, emitting sound waves of the screeching, squealing and scraping of the car. As it passes by you, you hear the pitch of the sound go down. The sound waves reach you less frequently, thus lowering the pitch. This would probably be a much more memorable experience 5 years from now, than the example video provided above. History Courses Finally, Virtual Reality could make the lecture and reading based history class one of the most fun courses for students by, similar to the business case applicability, fully immersing students into events of the past. Going to class, putting on a headset, and in the blink of an eye suddenly appearing moments before Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address would be nothing short of immersive and memorable. One thing history class can teach is the facts, but one it can not truly convey to students are the feelings felt throughout some historical events. Virtually being in the middle of the crowd during the ‘I have a Dream Speech’ would probably make any student understand the sheer magnitude of importance and emotions experienced at the moment. 4.4 Potential for the Future "],["company-use.html", "5 Company Use 5.1 Commerce 5.2 Entertainment", " 5 Company Use 5.1 Commerce With the rise of digital commerce, the Metaverse will unlock new opportunities for buyers and sellers to connect in a new way. You could imagine your shop on Instagram becoming more immersive, with the option to buy physical or digital products as we saw in Jackie Aina’s space during Connect. NFT One of the most popular commerce products in metaverse is NFT, which stands for Non-fungible token. “Non-fungible” means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. For example,A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you’d have something completely different. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you’d have something completely different. NFTs can really be anything digital (such as drawings, music, your brain downloaded and turned into an AI), but a lot of the current excitement is around using the tech to sell digital art.NFTs are designed to give you something that can’t be copied: ownership of the work (though the artist can still retain the copyright and reproduction rights, just like with physical artwork). To put it in terms of physical art collecting: anyone can buy a Monet print. But only one person can own the original. 5.2 Entertainment Today you can host a paid online event on Facebook, but imagine if you could make this a mixed-reality experience where people could join in person or buy a ticket for the virtual experience. We saw this during Connect when two friends were able to enjoy the same concert, one in person and the other joining in the metaverse. The Metaverse Application in Aespa The Aespa girl group debuted in 2020 and made the first move into the meta-universe market for the k-pop market. Aespa is the group formed by 8 people, but technically only 4 real humans, and the other 4 is their avatar.The company created an origin story for the group, setting a special identity for each of them.They were born to fight a group called the Black Mamba, which threatens the connection between girls and their avatars. This concept of combining teams and The Metaverse has been strongly welcomed by Generation Z. Each Music video is interspersed with a large amount of the Metaverse concepts, visual sound effects, and avatars performance. And this concept is also widely used in their CD products, by scanning the QR code on the CD, fans can view the videos and voices recorded by Aespa members through the mobile phone app, or interact with their avatars.The Metaverse market concept has brought extremely popularity to Aespa, and also made K-POP realize the power of the Metaverse concept. Perhaps in the future, we will see more K-pop idol groups using the concept of Metaverse. "],["sociocultural-implications.html", "6 Sociocultural Implications", " 6 Sociocultural Implications Metaverse will bring along as much change as the internet has done for human society years ago. It will create a bond between people from all over the world, but it will also pull people apart. When people interact in the Metaverse, they bring their own values and culture into the mix. If people are allowed to design an outfit for themselves in the Metaverse, some people may be inclined to wear something that they would normally be too embarrassed to wear. They might go for traditional outfits, or flashy ones that are very expressive of the individual’s personality. In a way, Metaverse, like the internet, allows people to be different, and embrace the difference. Metaverse will eventually form sub-cultures of its own, like the internet did over the years. It will be “used as a route to access a community, to influence their experiences and it can also be a means of social communion, just like the TV and radio before it.” Countless new ideas and values will merge and form a cultural norm strictly in the context of the Metaverse. The Metaverse will break down the geographical barriers in the real world, and create a universe without boundaries for people from different backgrounds. It brings about the interaction and overlay between the real and the digital. Like how the internet broke down barriers many years ago, the Metaverse is only going to magnify this effect. With VR technology, it will make sharing much easier and realistic. Right now we can only share pictures and videos. but with the help of VR headsets, other people can experience your content in 3D view. This will almost be like a more accessible and affordable traveling method. As a result, people can get to experience different countries, languages, cultures, and traditions without even stepping foot out of their house. Some experts think that the Metaverse will cause devastating effects on the global cultural environment. The Western values and norms are dominating the international community. The ideas are exported to the other continents and countries through social media, the entertainment industry, etc. The Metaverse, created by Meta and supported by mostly western companies, will be constructed with Western values and norms as its foundation. If we use Metaverse on a global scale, everyone will be immersed in the same digital cultural environment, which will “hasten the decline of political and cultural diversity”. Only a handful of superpower countries have more leverage in shaping the world’s shared culture. These cultural exchanges are unidirectional. In airports, you can only see ads from companies that are from politically and economically advantaged countries. The weaker countries only get to adopt the habits, traditions and even languages from the more powerful countries. And you may ask, how do some countries still have their unique traditions? In Spain, people are still maintaining their very different daily schedule. “One of the most powerful forces persevering distinct cultures and communities is their unique physical surroundings.” The unique physical surroundings give people the right place to practice their unique ways. Then culture is further strengthened through human interaction in the physical communities of those countries. From human interaction, we get the culturally-specific elements like food, fashion, entertainment, architecture, arts and literature, etc. The digital medium of interaction is impersonal. Right now the majority of us still prefer meeting face to face rather than phone calls and Facetime. If the Metaverse is widely adopted, it will reshape the cultural norms of many countries other than the US and Europe, from which the metaverse’s own norm is constructed. We are already seeing examples of this phenomenon, from the usage of English across all international businesses, to the social media platforms like Instagram, facebook, twitter, TikTok, where the community guidelines are built based on the western norms, and all the users must adhere to them, no matter where they are from. It is hard to say whether the political / ideological conflicts or differences between countries would cause individuals, communities, or companies to be banned from the Metaverse. For now we see posts being taken down on social media, but how will that materialize in the Metaverse. Will the individuals in question be banned from existing in the Metaverse, almost like that one episode of Black mirror? What will the cancel culture look like in the Metaverse? What does blocking someone look like? The lack of variation and competition will eventually dim down the creativity and diversity of our global community. If someone is dissatisfied with their country’s values, they can leave for another one which they think is better. But what if the Metaverse leads to the unification of values in the world, people will lose the ability to pick and choose. Ultimately, the Metaverse will potentially introduce the unification of values, norms, cultures, “exacerbating the existence of universal groupthink and cultural homogeneity” "],["burnout-and-health-effects.html", "7 Burnout and Health Effects 7.1 Avoiding Burnout 7.2 Dealing with Health Side Effects", " 7 Burnout and Health Effects 7.1 Avoiding Burnout Create a dedicated work space in the Metaverse In order to set boundaries between work and daily life, people should only put on the working headsets and accessories in a dedicated area of the room. By doing so, people would need to go to the workroom and start working. If the working headsets are put in the relaxing area of the room, people may casually start working, and it will be very hard to set boundaries. If you don’t have clear boundaries, your entire house will end up becoming a work space, even after hours. Set Working hours and strictly follow the schedule In remote work space, it is very easy for people to lose track of time, and the condition may be worse in the Metaverse. In a highly realistic Metaverse work space, people may not notice at the end of a work day, and continue to work after hours unintentionally. Therefore, it is crucial to have strict work hours, and be intentional about it. Although people tend to focus a lot on all their work, people need to keep track of time to avoid burnout. 7.2 Dealing with Health Side Effects Similar to gaming and social media, using VR too much will likely lead to behavioral addiction. The user or their family/friends would notice that the user’s quality of life is now suffering because of them being involved in VR. The addiction problem may take the form of ignoring everyday tasks, not wanting to engage with family/friends in real life, and getting frustrated when the user doesn’t get to use VR. Behavioral addiction can then lead to more mental health issues like mood disorder, stress, depression, and physical health issues like nausea, dizziness, disorientation, motion sickness. In order to step out of the negative loop, we suggest that users set a time limit to VR usage everyday. We suggest that the user’s friend or family member should take away the hardware when the time limit is up, so that the user will not be tempted to continue using it. We recommend that the user incorporate time for exercises or other activities that do not involve sitting down staring at the screen. Taking a walk outside, going to the gym, or simply hanging out with friends outside will be immensely beneficial to the user’s mental health. If the user’s addiction problem becomes increasingly out of control, we recommend the user get professional therapy. If you are currently suffering from any sort of behavioral addiction, please refer to these websites for professional guidance: SAMHSA "],["team-process.html", "8 Team Process", " 8 Team Process "],["about-us.html", "9 About Us 9.1 Mengna Wang 9.2 Remona Yu 9.3 Runze Huang 9.4 Jennifer Feng 9.5 Carlo De los Santos", " 9 About Us 9.1 Mengna Wang Hi, this is Mengna Wang.

[["background-information.html", "2 Background Information", " 2 Background Information What is VR VR, Virtual Reality, is a technology that simulates the real world in a virtual environment, and there are four important features that define this technology. Multi-Sensory: When people use current technology such as phones, computers, and television, the media generally stimulates them from the visual sensory, because most media is still two dimensional. Although movies now support three, or even four dimensional format, the lack of immersion stagnates the growth of these technologies. In virtual reality, people need to put on headsets and grab controllers to experience the simulated world, which leads to experience in multi-sensory. Other than visual sensory, people would experience auditory sensory, movement sensory, touching sensory, and even tasting sensory. In an ideal virtual reality, people should be able to experience most of the sensory they can experience in the real world Immersion: With the Multi-Sensory feature, people should be able to feel like they are in the real world. Therefore, a sensory experience is evaluated by the level of immersion that the system brings to users. A good virtual reality should give the users a hard time distinguishing the real world from the virtual world. Interactivity: Interactivity determines if Users are able to interact with objects in virtual reality. For instance, if users want to grab an object in virtual reality, the user needs to feel the momentum of grabbing and feel the weight of the object too. Imagination: Other than creating a world that highly simulates reality, Virtual Reality gives users the opportunity to create inventions and new ideas that are beyond reality. The ability to create things or life that are not in reality will unleash people’s imagination. What is the Metaverse? VR is the technology that allows people to enter a virtual environment, and Metaverse is a new social institution that allows people to meet and interact in virtual reality.
